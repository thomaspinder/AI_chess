# Chess AI Engine
This is a project for a MSc Distribute AI module whereby I implement UCT [source](https://github.com/tpin3694/chess_ai/blob/master/learning/online/uct.py) to *learn* the best move at any given board state. This online tree search algorithm is supported by a heuristic generated offline through a CNN [source](https://github.com/tpin3694/chess_ai/blob/master/learning/offline/cnn.py). The motivation behind this CNN comes from Deepmind's AlphaGo paper and similar to their work with Go, this network tried to predict the best move from a given board game. The data has been sourced from the LiChess database and a script [here](https://github.com/tpin3694/chess_ai/blob/master/learning/offline/cnn.py) can be used to source your own dataset - run `python get_pgns.py <Number of Files to Download> <Output Directory>` to do so. This script simply parses the list of .pgn files uses `curl` to download them and then extracts the contents to a user-specified directory
